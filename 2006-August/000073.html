&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> i have some problems with blocks count.
</I>&gt;<i> One group is 104 bytes. every group is composed by 4 blocks.
</I>&gt;<i> Every block is 26bit. 16bit of data and 10 of check.
</I>
Looking at RDS data this way is only important if you want to demodulate the 
bit stream yourself. If you're interested in that kind of stuff, it's well 
described in the RBDS manual (link on the rdsd homepage).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1&#176; Question : why the saa6588 module get every block with 3 bytes (24bit)
</I>&gt;<i> ... it discard 2 bit every time. Are them useless ?
</I>
No, they were used during demodulation. The SAA6588 chip already did this. 
After demodulation, there are 3 bytes left in each block. One byte just 
contains information what kind of block it is, the other two are the real 
data.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From debug=4 i got those messages :
</I>&gt;<i> saa6588: New block (0): 0x69 0xde 0x00 99 blocks total.
</I>&gt;<i> Saw block 0 again.
</I>&gt;<i> saa6588: New block (0): 0xee 0xa6 0x1b 99 blocks total.
</I>&gt;<i> Saw block 3 again.
</I>&gt;<i> saa6588: New block (0): 0x62 0xe6 0x12 99 blocks total.
</I>&gt;<i> saa6588: New block (0): 0x09 0x3b 0x09 99 blocks total.
</I>&gt;<i> Saw block 1 again.
</I>&gt;<i> saa6588: New block (1): 0xf7 0x73 0x24 99 blocks total.
</I>&gt;<i> Saw block 4 again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you see the third bytes have 5 values ... this mean 5 block (form 0 to
</I>&gt;<i> 4).
</I>&gt;<i> But the RDS talk about 4 block ...
</I>
That output doesn't look like a good RDS signal to me. But I didn't use these 
debug messages for a long time, I always test with rdsd. 

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2&#176; Question : How about this fifth type of block ?
</I>
In RDS, we normally have 4 types of blocks (A, B, C, D). There is a fifth type 
(C') which is treated as C. In RBDS there are also E blocks, but they can be 
safely ignored most of the time. But I have to admit, it's been a long time 
since I studied the manual about that.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3&#176; Question : As u see i never got 4 block correctly ordered. It's normal ?
</I>&gt;<i> How can i get the real order ?
</I>
What does rdsd say to that? Can it decode something?
Are you sure you have a good strong station tuned in?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4&#176; Question : Kenrel say Saw block x again. The module poll the chip, when
</I>&gt;<i> it say Saw block 4 again it mean that no new block are arrived ?! I dont
</I>&gt;<i> lost any packet ?
</I>
No, the kernel module never loses packets (that's why we do it in the kernel). 
The poll timer routine is slightly faster than the chip, so it often happens 
that it reads the same block twice. In that case, the second one is ignored, 
and that debug message appears.
