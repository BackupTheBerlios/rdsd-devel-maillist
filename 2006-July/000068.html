Yes, in theory. I prepared that feature for rdsd, but never had the time to 
test it. The difficulty is that not every card runs with the reset default 
register settings of the SAA6588 (e.g. xtal frequency other than 4...MHz). In 
that case, you also have to initialize the chip, which would require some 
extra parameters in the config file.

By the way, if you use i2c-dev, you MUST NOT use the saa6588 kernel module, 
otherwise two parties are trying to read from one chip. The main 
disadvantages of the i2c-dev approach is that you are very much 
hardware-dependent, you have no buffering, and you need to give your user 
access to /dev/i2c, which I consider a security leak. You can do evil things 
there aside from reading RDS data.

The proper way is to make the saa7134 driver use saa6588.ko for reads 
on /dev/radio. I sent in a patch in May, but it got lost. I'll rebuild/resend 
it as soon as I have the time.

Daniele Ravizza posted some time ago that he's got that running (using my old 
patch, see the June 2006 archives). Maybe he can help you?
