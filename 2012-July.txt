Subject: [Rdsd-devel] Polling mode or interrupt-driven mode?
Message-ID: <500828FC.2060600@gmail.com>

Hello All !
I'm new here. I want to thank you for your hard job with this project. 
It's really good.
Let me introduce myself. I live in Poland, and i'm working in a 
radio-company. I'm very familiar with RDS toys :)
Let me ask you a question - is the saa6588 driver work ok for you? Can 
you compare it to other receivers?
I'm asking about that, becouse i've noticed, that quality of decoded 
bitstream isn't realy good. There are many out-of-sequence packets and 
so on.
I've patched the driver for checking data overflow flag. The flag was 
set in every 4 or 5 received packets. That's really bad. It means, that 
we (i) have a lots of data lost.
I'm using FlyVideo3000 card from LifeView with ADDED RDS SAA6588 chip 
soldiered to i2c bus of the board :) Maybe that is the reason of the bad 
performance?
There are several hi-res picrures of saa6588-equiped tuners, but all of 
them have connected DAVN output of saa6588 to some GPIO pin of SAA7134(5).
Could anyone check if it's really true? If so, can you track the trace 
of PCB and check to which one of GPIO it's connected? It's really 
important, becouse in my opinion it should be connected. IMHO the driver 
should work in interrupt mode instead of polling mode. Saa6588 is 
designed to indicate presence of valid data by pulling down DAVN pin, so 
uC can read i2c data immediately. If there is no such a thing, we can 
loss a lots of data.

Thanks again.

Michal.
