Oh, that's good - I am speaking at LinuxTag as well - I am talking about 
GPSdrive, Kismet, and more :)

Maybe we can meet there ?

Indeed - I have found some clues about TMC, but not much, however I do not yet 
have an RDS-capable radio receiver (I'm happy to get a PCI or PCMCIA one for 
development and testing purposes, but would find USB far more convenient for 
the system I have installed in my car).    Therefore I haven't yet done any 
investigation of how things seem to be encoded.

I wonder whether the lack of information about TMC is because:

 - nobody has yet looked into this as a publicly accessible open source of 
data

 - the suppliers of the data are actively hiding the specifications and making 
it difficult to obtain

 - the standards are available but at a very high price
?

As far as I can tell, different countries have very different positions 
regarding public traffic data - much of Europe seems to have subscription- 
free access to TMC data signals, but the UK (where I am based) sells mainly 
subscription-based TMC/GPS equipment (although some GPS systems are available 
with subscription-free TMC, just at a higher price).
