Great, these are tools I use, too. I always wanted to have a connection

&gt;<i>

Yes, sure! Booth 105, IIRC. I'm there every day.

</I>
The only open source I'm aware of used to be here:

<A HREF="http://www.siski.de/~carsten/rds-dekoder.html">http://www.siski.de/~carsten/rds-dekoder.html</A>

It was written in C and did some TMC decoding. It doesn't seem to be there 
anymore, at least I can't find it. Fortunately, I've still got a copy :-) 
Most of it is included in rdsd, anyway.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - the suppliers of the data are actively hiding the specifications and
</I>&gt;<i> making it difficult to obtain
</I>
Yes, to make money.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - the standards are available but at a very high price
</I>&gt;<i> ?
</I>Yes, and only under NDA.

This will tell you everything: <A HREF="http://www.tmcforum.com/">http://www.tmcforum.com/</A>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, different countries have very different positions

</I>
Well, if you've got a radio card with RDS decoder, you should be able to 
decode at least the basic RDS information. Usually, you only have to pay for 
special services transmitted via ODA groups.  But it is well possible that 
some stations don't send normal TMC groups but only ODA. You'll have to find 
out. By the way, specifying a good interface for ODA is still an open issue 
for rdsd/librds. Suggestions are welcome.
