Well, rdsd will do that. The decoder expects bytes as specified by V4L2, so 
I'll have to modify them.

&gt;<i> But I've got a problem:
</I>&gt;<i> my application needs to use the last 2 bytes sent by SAA6588 (byte 5 and
</I>&gt;<i> byte 6), which give: number of errors and signal quality. (In fact, my
</I>&gt;<i> application is aimed to analyse RDS quality signal and quality reception
</I>&gt;<i> at different points).
</I>
Yes, I noticed that problem, too. There should probably be an ioctl() that 
returns some kind of RDS quality. But it's a problem to make that hardware 
independent. I wanted to add some quality functionality by analyzing for 
example the ratio of valid and invalid groups. There might be faster 
algorithms to calculate some measure for quality, too. I'm open for 
suggestions. For &quot;i2cdev&quot;, the quality read from the SAA6588 could easily be 
used.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I wonder if I should use your code and try to add the needed
</I>&gt;<i> functionnality, or if I should better implement new code as I needs to
</I>&gt;<i> decode directly from I2C, and I need to capture data as soon as
</I>&gt;<i> possible, for example as soon as I receive the block A with PI
</I>&gt;<i> information, I need to return it immediately to client application...
</I>&gt;<i> So, I don't know yet the best solution.
</I>
Neither do I. I tried it that way, but noticed that (depending on signal 
strength) you receive A LOT of faulty RDS blocks that have NO error flag set. 
IMHO it is best to receive complete groups and then decode them. That is what 
rdsd does, and you immediately receive an event for PI after each group. If 
you look at each block separately, you'll get a lot of stange PI codes and 
need extra code to decide whether you trust them or not.

I guess you need that for fast tuning. In such applications, you'll have to 
wait for more than one PI anyway, to be sure it's valid. In that case, you 
can as well wait for a whole group as rdsd does.
 
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Concerning the read from SAA6588, you read 6 bytes, but in my SAA6588
</I>&gt;<i> specs, they say to read 7 bytes (byte 0 to byte 6). So what happends
</I>&gt;<i> when you only read 6 bytes ?
</I>
In fact, I only use the first 3 bytes. But reading 3 bytes didn't work in my 
tests, so I tried to read 6 bytes, and that works.
