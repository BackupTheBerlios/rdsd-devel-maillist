Hi Guillaume,
welcome to the list!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in the man page of rdsd, you write:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The type &quot;i2cdev&quot;  was  supposed  to read  data  from a SAA6588 directly
</I>&gt;<i> via I2C. This is deprecated now and will probably go away soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you tell me why you're going to remove this functionnality ?
</I>&gt;<i> Because I was going to use it this way. In fact, I'm developing a card
</I>&gt;<i> with ARM processor, linux-based, and i've got a SAA6588 chip connected
</I>&gt;<i> via i2c.
</I>&gt;<i> So I think I will read bytes directly via I2C. Do you think it's a wrong
</I>&gt;<i> method ?
</I>
No, surely that's a sort of application where &quot;i2cdev&quot; would be useful. If you 
build your own embedded system, you probably don't have a video chip like 
BT8x8 or SAA7134 on board. In that case you won't have a /dev/radio, 
and /dev/i2c is your only chance. If you have a bttv/saa7134 chip on board, 
you should definetly use the driver for that.

All right, I'll keep &quot;i2cdev&quot;. This means I'll have to fix it. IIRC, at the 
moment the byte order is not correct. I will file a bug against rdsd in the 
bug tracker. Hope I can fix this within a week or so.

A disadvantage of /dev/i2c is that it doesn't buffer incoming bytes. So, if 
rdsd cannot read fast enough, some bytes are lost. The saa6588 kernel module 
prevents this by buffering 300 bytes (default). This gives you two or three 
seconds headroom. Another disadvantage is that /dev/i2c will only work for 
SAA6588 chips, which makes rdsd hardware dependend. Those were the main 
reasons why I wanted to drop it, but I'll keep it now as somebody has a use 
for it.

By the way, I'd be interested in a radio card with ARM processor. Will the 
card you develop be available somewhere?

Cheers,
Hans
