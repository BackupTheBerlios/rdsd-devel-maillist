<PRE>Hi Stan,
Sorry for answering so late, but as I told you, I was on holidays.
Now, my reply:

&gt;<i> Hans,
</I>&gt;<i>     Sorry about all the stupid questions. 
</I>
There is no such thing. Just because a question seems to be easy to answer by 
some persons doesn't make it stupid.

&gt;<i>     I really 
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate your help on this subject.
</I>
We should probably return to the rdsd mailing list with these questions and 
answers, so that others can appreciate it, too :-)

I cc the list, and ask you to reply to the list.

&gt;<i> It seems like 
</I>&gt;<i> not many people know much about RDS. 
</I>
I don't know, it's not such a difficult topic...

&gt;<i> I have another 
</I>&gt;<i> question,   I was looking over the RBDS spec and I
</I>&gt;<i> noticed in the data-link layer description about error
</I>&gt;<i> protection and checksum.  I noticed that in your RDS
</I>&gt;<i> decoder you are dont do any error correction.  Will
</I>&gt;<i> that be done in the driver you are working on?  or is
</I>&gt;<i> the error correction done on the hardware?
</I>
As for the SAA6588, error correction is done in hardware. V4L2 specs say that 
in each block there are flags that tell you wether the block is OK, had 
errors that could be corrected, or has uncorrectable errors. It's up to rdsd 
to decide how to deal with errors. This is not as trivial as it seems, e.g. 
if a block containing 4 characters of radio text has errors, should the whole 
string of 64 chars be thrown away ? What else can be done ? There are 
certainly many possible strategies. And there is not only radio text... 

Hans
