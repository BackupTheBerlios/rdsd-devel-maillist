</I>This should be a general ODA interface, where all
services are passed through to the client.


&gt;<i> &gt; My interest was mainly in decoding Differential

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>There's no open documentation on that, I'm afraid. All
I have is a short document with reverse engineered
information. (Done by a ham, you know those guys...)


&gt;<i> Any contribution is welcome. Could you post your

</I>&gt;<i> implement
</I>&gt;<i> the whole stuff. I can give you write access to the
</I>&gt;<i> SVN
</I>&gt;<i> repository then.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Ok, here are my first thoughts about it:

1.
A client will register with rdsd (via librds) for one
or more ODA services. rdsd will generate an event
every time a group for that ODA service is received.
This is the same procedure used for other information
already (lrtxt, picode, ...).

2.
The event should look like 'oda:&lt;aid&gt;:&lt;group&gt;:&lt;data&gt;',
where &lt;aid&gt; is the application id, group is the name
of the group in which the data was received (e.g.
'11A'), and data is, well, the data :-)
An application may span several groups at a time,
that's why we need to include the group name. There's
also application specific data already in the 3A
group.

3.
Class RDSdecoder decodes all known content now, and
stores it locally. New data generates an event, so
that every client, who registered for that specific
data, can be informed. TMC data is stored locally as
well, and is only deleted after a certain lifetime
expired.

ODA data cannot be handled this way: There's no
knowledge about content, and there's no lifetime
associated with the data.
So we have to distribute it immediately, to an
arbitrary number of clients. As a client may be slow
in fetching the data, there must be some sort of
buffering based on a client connection. I think the
best place to put that queue would be the RDSclient
class itself. So there will be one ODA queue per
application per client.

4.
RadioText+ can be handled differently, in addition to
passing it through to clients transparently: As it
augments the existing RadioText, we may think of a
special interface for it. RT+ documentation suggests
to use some sort of markup language for it, which may
be a good idea for RT+ in rdsd as well.


What do you think about it?

Cheers,
Rolf
