</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I started looking into receiving ODA (Open Data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Application) with rdsd.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are you interested in a general ODA interface or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just in decoding a special service?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This should be a general ODA interface, where all
</I>&gt;<i> services are passed through to the client.
</I>
OK, agreed.

[...]

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, here are my first thoughts about it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.
</I>&gt;<i> A client will register with rdsd (via librds) for one
</I>&gt;<i> or more ODA services. rdsd will generate an event
</I>&gt;<i> every time a group for that ODA service is received.
</I>&gt;<i> This is the same procedure used for other information
</I>&gt;<i> already (lrtxt, picode, ...).
</I>
Yes, it's quite clear that is has to be done that way.
We'll have to look at some internals, though. The event
mask is an unsigned long at the moment, we have to make 
this a 64 bit int, otherwise we probably run out of
free bits.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.
</I>&gt;<i> The event should look like 'oda:&lt;aid&gt;:&lt;group&gt;:&lt;data&gt;',
</I>&gt;<i> where &lt;aid&gt; is the application id, group is the name
</I>&gt;<i> of the group in which the data was received (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> '11A'), and data is, well, the data :-)
</I>&gt;<i> An application may span several groups at a time,
</I>&gt;<i> that's why we need to include the group name. There's
</I>&gt;<i> also application specific data already in the 3A
</I>&gt;<i> group.
</I>
Allright, that looks good.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.
</I>&gt;<i> Class RDSdecoder decodes all known content now, and
</I>&gt;<i> stores it locally. New data generates an event, so
</I>&gt;<i> that every client, who registered for that specific
</I>&gt;<i> data, can be informed. TMC data is stored locally as
</I>&gt;<i> well, and is only deleted after a certain lifetime
</I>&gt;<i> expired.
</I>
Yes, that's the idea.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ODA data cannot be handled this way: There's no
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge about content, and there's no lifetime
</I>&gt;<i> associated with the data.
</I>&gt;<i> So we have to distribute it immediately, to an
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary number of clients. As a client may be slow
</I>&gt;<i> in fetching the data, there must be some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> buffering based on a client connection. I think the
</I>&gt;<i> best place to put that queue would be the RDSclient
</I>&gt;<i> class itself. So there will be one ODA queue per
</I>&gt;<i> application per client.
</I>
OK.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.
</I>&gt;<i> RadioText+ can be handled differently, in addition to
</I>&gt;<i> passing it through to clients transparently: As it
</I>&gt;<i> augments the existing RadioText, we may think of a
</I>&gt;<i> special interface for it. RT+ documentation suggests
</I>&gt;<i> to use some sort of markup language for it, which may
</I>&gt;<i> be a good idea for RT+ in rdsd as well.
</I>
I don't know enough about RT+ to comment on that.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think about it?
</I>
Looks like a good concept, go on!

Hans
