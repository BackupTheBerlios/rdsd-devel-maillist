&gt;<i> Hello Hans,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your quick reply.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm glad you confirmed that my understanding of the current kernel/driver

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some thoughts..............
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question/Remark 1
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I remember from my active days as a UNIX systems administrator, I
</I>&gt;<i> know that there were &quot;raw-&quot; and &quot;block&quot; IO-devices.
</I>&gt;<i> I think this will still be the situation in LINUX(-es) today?

</I>&gt;<i> Say somthing like eg. &quot;/dev/rrds00&quot; and &quot;/dev/rds00&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could be an inplementation of a similar (blocked-)device like a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;/dev/tty&quot; (it is in fact some kind of asynchronous serial device/UART!),
</I>&gt;<i> be it blocked in
</I>&gt;<i> a. hardware (like with saa6588) or
</I>&gt;<i> b. in driver/kernel sofware
</I>&gt;<i> or a raw
</I>&gt;<i> c. A (character/byte-) device?
</I>
RDS data read from /dev/radio is still &quot;raw data&quot;. You get a stream of 
3-byte-blocks that still need decoding (that's what rdsd does). The good 
thing is that these blocks always have the same format, no matter from which 
hardware they come.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question/Remark 2
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the relation in software with &quot;Video for LINUX&quot; and RDS is not a
</I>&gt;<i> verry obvious one since its only relation is/was I think the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> TV/Radio cards supported an acces method to the RDS/Radio hardware?
</I>
For historical reason, radio is also handled by Video4Linux drivers. There is 
no such thing as &quot;Radio4Linux&quot;. Even drivers for very old ISA radio-only 
cards are within the video4linux kernel subsystem.

&gt;<i> Or is there also some application of RDS (higher level protocol or so) for
</I>&gt;<i> TV/Video that I am not aware of?
</I>
No.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think a more &quot;general&quot; RDS kernel device separated from V4L2 would be
</I>&gt;<i> desirable?
</I>
No, I don't think so. In the end, all you need is a device file from which you 
can read your data blocks. This device usually has an associated tuner to 
select the radio station. This is both possible with /dev/radio. If you had 
an extra /dev/rds, you'd run into conflicts with the tuner or you'd need to 
open /dev/rds for data and /dev/radio for tuning. If you have several radio 
cards, how do you know that /dev/rds0 actually belongs to /dev/radio0 ?

&gt;<i> Think also of the special TMC receivers that are available today (Serial?
</I>&gt;<i> USB? Bluetooth?)
</I>
It would be nice if somebody would write a V4L2 driver for these.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry if I am disrupting an existing situation, just my opinion/thoughts!
</I>
You're welcome. It is good if I review my opinions sometimes.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you please inform me of:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who/how many people are currently actively developping RDS/TMC applications
</I>&gt;<i> for LINUX that you are aware of?
</I>
There might be quite a few people out there, but they either cancel there 
projects after a while, or at least they don't publish them. I seem to be the 
only one with a V4L2 compliant approach. My saa6588 kernel driver is also the 
only module in the official kernel that handles an RDS decoder chip.

&gt;<i> What projects are these?
</I>
Lots of people seem to build their own hardware and connect them to a 
microcontroller or a PC. They write software that supports only their 
hardware and their application. Therefore, nobody else is interested in it, 
and they seldom publish it.

&gt;<i> What is their status?
</I>
I can only speak for my project: After presenting it at the Linuxtag in May, I 
had very little time to continue coding. I had a job where I spent one hour 
each day in my car just to drive there and back again. Fortunately, this is 
over now. That'll give me 5 extra hours each week and, hopefully, this will 
lead to some progress for the RDS project. Next steps will be:

* Get saa7134 RDS support into the kernel.
* Add TMC decoding
* Make Debian packages

At the moment, rdsd is quite stable and can decode basic stuff like date/time, 
radiotext or station name. I've got it running continously for several days 
without problems. I wrote a small superkaramba script that shows radiotext 
directly on my desktop. Of course, I'd appreciate it if somebody wrote a 
decent GUI using librds.

Cheers,
Hans
