<PRE>Hello everybody,
 
 
As the Subject of this mail says: I'm new to this list...
 
I am verry interested in RDS software, TMC in particular and freeware
navigation software in general.
Unfortunately I have little usefull software knowledge at the moment
(working on it......  ;-)    ) but I do know a few things on hardware and
datacommunication in general.
 
That is what my first question is about:
I read the previous postings and it seems that everybody is using some
TV/Radio card with saa7134/saa6588 or similar on it?
 
As far as I understand it now:
This gives you the opportunity to use a standard kernel driver in LINUX and
the TV/Radio card-hardware to access the RDS datastream.
The SAA6588 also decodes the bitstream for you and nicely delivers the data
in blocks to the driver wich than can be used by the daemon software rdsd.
 
Also I think I read that people are having trouble to find a compatible card
with one of these IC's.
 
Maybe I'm telling something you all already know but in fact it's verry easy
to have access to a raw RDS datastream.
On the web there are numerous projects that describe how to do this with a
standard  FM (car-)radio, maybe with the help of a little extra hardware.
 
Since the emphasis for this project (obviously) is software maybe it can
help to have a simple source for raw RDS testdata without having the trouble
of getting these out of a complex TV/Radiocard?
 
Another observation would be that there is currently no possibility to work
with the raw bitstream (I mean the non decoded/blocked data coming out of an
&quot;old&quot; RDS decoder-IC such as the 7330B) in LINUX? (you would have to do the
bitstream decoding/blocking yourself in software)
 
Would like to have oppinions/clarifications from you on this.
 
Regards,
 
Henry.
