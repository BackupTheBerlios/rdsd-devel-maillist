</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello Hans,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you for your quick reply.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm glad you confirmed that my understanding of the current 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kernel/driver situation for RDS is somewhat correct...... ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some thoughts..............
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Question/Remark 1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as I remember from my active days as a UNIX systems 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; administrator, I know that there were &quot;raw-&quot; and &quot;block&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> IO-devices. I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think this will still be the situation in LINUX(-es) today? Would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; therefore a comparable device structure for rds-devices not be more 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feasible? Say something like e.g.. &quot;/dev/rrds00&quot; and &quot;/dev/rds00&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This could be an implementation of a similar 
</I>&gt;<i> (blocked-)device like a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;/dev/tty&quot; (it is in fact some kind of asynchronous serial 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; device/UART!), be it blocked in a. hardware (like with saa6588) or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; b. in driver/kernel software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or a raw
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; c. A (character/byte-) device?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> RDS data read from /dev/radio is still &quot;raw data&quot;. You get a 
</I>&gt;<i> stream of 
</I>&gt;<i> 3-byte-blocks that still need decoding (that's what rdsd 
</I>&gt;<i> does). The good 
</I>&gt;<i> thing is that these blocks always have the same format, no 
</I>&gt;<i> matter from which 
</I>&gt;<i> hardware they come.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
This is all a matter of how you define &quot;raw&quot;!!  ;-) :
I'm used as a former SA to think in this case off &quot;raw&quot; as unprocessed,
transparent, not interpreted.
In the case of /dev/rrds to me it would be a stream of bits (bytes) for
witch you have to do the error checking/repair, strip the extra error
correction info bits.
In the block device /dev/rds you have the error corrected data and have the
&quot;real&quot; data.
To me such a device is similar to a tty device in the sense that it is
&quot;&#239;nterpreted&quot;, processed upon. (Compare rtty and tty)
In the situation where you do not have the radio &quot;inside&quot; the PC but as some
external unit (Serial, USB, Bluetooth) or do not have the control over the
radio (no tuning, mode selection etc., only data input) it seems more
appropriate (simpler) to me.

But I agree, for the application-level this would be still raw data.....

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Question/Remark 2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -----------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the relation in software with &quot;Video for LINUX&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> RDS is not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a very obvious one since its only relation is/was I think the fact 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that TV/Radio cards supported an access method to the RDS/Radio 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hardware?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For historical reason, radio is also handled by Video4Linux 
</I>&gt;<i> drivers. There is 
</I>&gt;<i> no such thing as &quot;Radio4Linux&quot;. Even drivers for very old ISA 
</I>&gt;<i> radio-only 
</I>&gt;<i> cards are within the video4linux kernel subsystem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or is there also some application of RDS (higher level 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol or so) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for TV/Video that I am not aware of?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think a more &quot;general&quot; RDS kernel device separated from 
</I>&gt;<i> V4L2 would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be desirable?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, I don't think so. In the end, all you need is a device 
</I>&gt;<i> file from which you 
</I>&gt;<i> can read your data blocks. This device usually has an 
</I>&gt;<i> associated tuner to 
</I>&gt;<i> select the radio station. This is both possible with 
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/radio. If you had 
</I>&gt;<i> an extra /dev/rds, you'd run into conflicts with the tuner or 
</I>&gt;<i> you'd need to 
</I>&gt;<i> open /dev/rds for data and /dev/radio for tuning. If you have 
</I>&gt;<i> several radio 
</I>&gt;<i> cards, how do you know that /dev/rds0 actually belongs to 
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/radio0 ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I see an RDS interface not per s&#233; as a radio but more as some data-source. 
A data source you can tune the frequency of, make mode selections and so on,
sure, but no &quot;real&quot; radio.
(Think of special TMC receiver hardware)
That would be a separate device I could set Volume, treble, bass and so on
and that I would actual be listening to.
And why not talk (for the setup of the radio etc.) to a device &quot;/dev/rds&quot;
(Just one device, no separate device &quot;/dev/radio&quot; at all required)?

And:

History is history................ ;-)



&gt;<i> &gt; Think also of the special TMC receivers that are available today 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Serial? USB? Bluetooth?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice if somebody would write a V4L2 driver for these.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry if I am disrupting an existing situation, just my 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opinion/thoughts!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're welcome. It is good if I review my opinions sometimes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could you please inform me of:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Who/how many people are currently actively developing RDS/TMC 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications for LINUX that you are aware of?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There might be quite a few people out there, but they either 
</I>&gt;<i> cancel there 
</I>&gt;<i> projects after a while, or at least they don't publish them. 
</I>&gt;<i> I seem to be the 
</I>&gt;<i> only one with a V4L2 compliant approach. My saa6588 kernel 
</I>&gt;<i> driver is also the 
</I>&gt;<i> only module in the official kernel that handles an RDS decoder chip.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What projects are these?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lots of people seem to build their own hardware and connect them to a 
</I>&gt;<i> microcontroller or a PC. They write software that supports only their 
</I>&gt;<i> hardware and their application. Therefore, nobody else is 
</I>&gt;<i> interested in it, 
</I>&gt;<i> and they seldom publish it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is their status?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can only speak for my project: After presenting it at the 
</I>&gt;<i> Linuxtag in May, I 
</I>&gt;<i> had very little time to continue coding. I had a job where I 
</I>&gt;<i> spent one hour 
</I>&gt;<i> each day in my car just to drive there and back again. 
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately, this is 
</I>&gt;<i> over now. That'll give me 5 extra hours each week and, 
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully, this will 
</I>&gt;<i> lead to some progress for the RDS project.
</I>
I had the same situation for many, many years (and a job witch involved a
lot of overtime etc.)
I agree it takes a lot of precious time out of your personal life.
Not to speak of the frequent traffic jams.
Ehhh, right, there is a nice app. named RDS for such
situations..................... ;-)
 

&gt;<i> Next steps will be:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Get saa7134 RDS support into the kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> * Add TMC decoding
</I>
And of course TMC message presentation/display!! (not only decoding!!)......
The really difficult app in my opinion.
Not only the use (and keeping it up to date!!) of a database to translate
the TMC codes to actual messages/locations in a particular language, but
also operational aspects of situations.

Let alone getting this info in some sort of navigation app........

&gt;<i> * Make Debian packages
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment, rdsd is quite stable and can decode basic 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff like date/time, 
</I>&gt;<i> radiotext or station name. I've got it running continuously 
</I>&gt;<i> for several days 
</I>&gt;<i> without problems. I wrote a small superkaramba script that 
</I>&gt;<i> shows radiotext 
</I>&gt;<i> directly on my desktop. Of course, I'd appreciate it if 
</I>&gt;<i> somebody wrote a 
</I>&gt;<i> decent GUI using librds.
</I>
I thought about that.
I think it would be nice and a good strategy/starting point to develop some
sort of command line interface and -application witch uses a standard
command set to perform basic actions on all types of supported RDS hardware
(Something like the standard modem &quot;AT command&quot; set), maybe using rdslib ??.

E.g.. Simple commands like &quot;Set Frequency&quot;, &quot;Set PTY mode&quot;, &quot;Set TA mode&quot;,
&quot;Read Frequency&quot;, &quot;Read Mode&quot;, &quot;Start reading RDS Data&quot; and such.

All standard GUI applications should adhere to such a standard and could be
used with all hardware for which this interface would be implemented.


Utopia?!

Again only my 2 cents worth opinion and what I understand of it!!

Or am I way of base/dreamin' ??   :-)

Regards,

Henry.
