&gt;<i> Hello everybody,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the Subject of this mail says: I'm new to this list...
</I>
Welcome!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am verry interested in RDS software, TMC in particular and freeware
</I>&gt;<i> navigation software in general.
</I>
So am I.

&gt;<i> Unfortunately I have little usefull software knowledge at the moment
</I>&gt;<i> (working on it......  ;-)    ) but I do know a few things on hardware and
</I>&gt;<i> datacommunication in general.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is what my first question is about:
</I>&gt;<i> I read the previous postings and it seems that everybody is using some
</I>&gt;<i> TV/Radio card with saa7134/saa6588 or similar on it?
</I>
Well, the answer to this is simple: There is exactly one specified way to 
handle RDS data under Linux. It's described in the V4L2 API specifications. 
Note that this is a great advantage over other operating systems which don't 
have a clearly defined API for RDS data.

Consequently, rdsd follows V4L2 specs, and reads RDS data from devices that 
have a V4L2 compliant driver. At the moment, these are mainly ordinary 
TV/Radio cards with bttv or saa7134 chipsets. All of these cards use a 
SAA6588 RDS decoder, if they have RDS capability.

The only other hardware I have is this:
<A HREF="http://www.ov-lennestadt.de/projekte/ukw-radio/">http://www.ov-lennestadt.de/projekte/ukw-radio/</A> (in German only)
It's made for educational purposes by German radio amateurs. The device is 
connected to a serial port, and they wrote a Linux driver that makes it look 
like a V4L2 device. As a consequence, it works fine with any radio 
application and with rdsd, although it doesn't use a SAA6588. That's the way 
exotic hardware should be handled.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I understand it now:
</I>&gt;<i> This gives you the opportunity to use a standard kernel driver in LINUX and
</I>&gt;<i> the TV/Radio card-hardware to access the RDS datastream.
</I>&gt;<i> The SAA6588 also decodes the bitstream for you and nicely delivers the data
</I>&gt;<i> in blocks to the driver wich than can be used by the daemon software rdsd.
</I>
Yes, the saa6588 kernel driver is quite simple, since the SAA6588 already does 
all the dirty work.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also I think I read that people are having trouble to find a compatible
</I>&gt;<i> card with one of these IC's.
</I>
Yes, it's getting more and more difficult. RDS capability doesn't seem to be 
an important feature that people are willing to pay for, so manufacturers 
seem to phase out these cards.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I'm telling something you all already know but in fact it's verry
</I>&gt;<i> easy to have access to a raw RDS datastream.
</I>&gt;<i> On the web there are numerous projects that describe how to do this with a
</I>&gt;<i> standard  FM (car-)radio, maybe with the help of a little extra hardware.
</I>
Yes, of course you can solder an RDS decoder IC to the output of any tuner. It 
shouldn't even be difficult to upgrade a radio card with an SAA6588 by 
connecting its I2C bus to the I2C bus of the tuner.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since the emphasis for this project (obviously) is software maybe it can
</I>&gt;<i> help to have a simple source for raw RDS testdata without having the
</I>&gt;<i> trouble of getting these out of a complex TV/Radiocard?
</I>
As rdsd can read from a simple file, this is easy. There is a file with a few 
minutes of RDS test data on the rdsd homepage.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another observation would be that there is currently no possibility to work
</I>&gt;<i> with the raw bitstream (I mean the non decoded/blocked data coming out of
</I>&gt;<i> an &quot;old&quot; RDS decoder-IC such as the 7330B) in LINUX? (you would have to do
</I>&gt;<i> the bitstream decoding/blocking yourself in software)
</I>
This is clearly a kernel driver task. If you wrote e.g. a 7330B driver, you 
would have to convert data from the chip (however it looks like) to V4L2 
format. If the chip is accessible via the video chip's I2C bus, it would work 
out of the box. If you need to access it some other way, you need some 
additional effort, as in the radio amateur project mentioned above.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would like to have oppinions/clarifications from you on this.
</I>
HTH,
Hans
