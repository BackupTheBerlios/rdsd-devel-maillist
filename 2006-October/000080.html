</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is all a matter of how you define &quot;raw&quot;!!  ;-) :

</I>
Why would you want to do all that yourself? What could be an application that 
needs that?

&gt;<i> In the block device /dev/rds you have the error corrected data and have the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;real&quot; data.
</I>
RDS data will always be a character device.

&gt;<i> To me such a device is similar to a tty device in the sense that it is
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&#239;nterpreted&quot;, processed upon. (Compare rtty and tty)
</I>&gt;<i> In the situation where you do not have the radio &quot;inside&quot; the PC but as
</I>&gt;<i> some external unit (Serial, USB, Bluetooth) or do not have the control over
</I>&gt;<i> the radio (no tuning, mode selection etc., only data input) it seems more
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate (simpler) to me.
</I>
OK, but such exotic things like tuners without tuning are still covered by 
V4L2 specs. Just let the respective IOCTRL do nothing...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I agree, for the application-level this would be still raw data.....
</I>
An application should avoid reading RDS data directly from the device file. If 
you want to use rdsd, you MUST NOT read from /dev/radio!
Applications should always use librds to read decoded data from rdsd. 
Otherwise they reinvent the wheel. A nice side effect is that they get 
network capability for free. You can have a radio card in one server and 
distribute decoded RDS data to your whole LAN.

One word to all developers:
If rdsd doesn't decode the data you need yet, please don't start writing a 
whole new application, but add it to rdsd. I'll give you all the help you 
need.  


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see an RDS interface not per s&#233; as a radio but more as some data-source.
</I>&gt;<i> A data source you can tune the frequency of, make mode selections and so
</I>&gt;<i> on, sure, but no &quot;real&quot; radio.
</I>&gt;<i> (Think of special TMC receiver hardware)
</I>
As I said, most RDS receivers ARE radios. Special TMC hardware can easily be 
seen as a radio with missing features. Even normal radios usually don't 
implement all features. No need for two devices.

A real problem I am aware of is RDS data sent via DVB. The DVB guys told me 
they receive RDS groups along with the video stream and decode them in their 
user space applications. It would be nice if they could find a way to make 
their RDS raw data available, e.g through a unix domain socket, so that rdsd 
could be used for decoding. I didn't have the time to further discuss this 
issue with them.

&gt;<i> That would be a separate device I could set Volume, treble, bass and so on
</I>&gt;<i> and that I would actual be listening to.
</I>&gt;<i> And why not talk (for the setup of the radio etc.) to a device &quot;/dev/rds&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (Just one device, no separate device &quot;/dev/radio&quot; at all required)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> History is history................ ;-)
</I>
Sure, but I can tell you straight away that you would not get such an approach 
into the official kernel. If you want to change V4L2 specs, you'll have to 
give your reasons and discuss them on the V4L mailing list. If you even want 
to introduce a new character device, you'd need the OK from Linus, Andrew and 
others which you'll never get.

Of course you're always free to write your own kernel module that does all 
that you like. If you have a special application that really needs e.g. the 
raw bit stream, this is the only way you can do it. But you won't get that 
module into the official kernel, as it violates V4L2 specs.

&gt;<i> &gt; * Add TMC decoding
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And of course TMC message presentation/display!! (not only
</I>&gt;<i> decoding!!)...... The really difficult app in my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> Not only the use (and keeping it up to date!!) of a database to translate
</I>&gt;<i> the TMC codes to actual messages/locations in a particular language, but
</I>&gt;<i> also operational aspects of situations.
</I>
Yes, of course. I'll start by adding event decoding. First, you need 
information about the type of event to decode the rest. Second, the Event 
Table is the same for all countries, while the location tables are different. 
The conversion of event and location numbers to clear text has to be done by 
rdsd, otherwise each application would need it's own tables. I'll add new 
functions to librds to allow applications to query clear text TMC messages in 
a selectable language. 

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let alone getting this info in some sort of navigation app........
</I>
I'm working on that, too. But it's still in planning, too early to publish 
something.


&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, I'd appreciate it if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; somebody wrote a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decent GUI using librds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought about that.
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be nice and a good strategy/starting point to develop some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of command line interface and -application witch uses a standard
</I>&gt;<i> command set to perform basic actions on all types of supported RDS hardware
</I>&gt;<i> (Something like the standard modem &quot;AT command&quot; set), maybe using rdslib
</I>&gt;<i> ??.
</I>
Did you ever have a look at the code? There is a command line application 
called &quot;rdsquery&quot; that does that. In my superkaramba script, I call rdsquery 
every 5 seconds, it gets the last radiotext string, and superkaramba displays 
it on my desktop. Of course, you can do many more things with such a 
commandline tool.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> E.g.. Simple commands like &quot;Set Frequency&quot;, &quot;Set PTY mode&quot;, &quot;Set TA mode&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Read Frequency&quot;, &quot;Read Mode&quot;, &quot;Start reading RDS Data&quot; and such.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All standard GUI applications should adhere to such a standard and could be
</I>&gt;<i> used with all hardware for which this interface would be implemented.
</I>
The standard for GUI applications is the librds API.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Utopia?!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again only my 2 cents worth opinion and what I understand of it!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or am I way of base/dreamin' ??   :-)
</I>
No, but did you ever read the V4L2 API specs? Or the INSTALL/README/manpages 
that are included in the rdsd/librds/rdsquery distribution? If not, you 
should do so.

Cheers,
Hans
