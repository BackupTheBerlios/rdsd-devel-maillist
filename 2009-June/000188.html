As far as I can tell the project is dead.

I started it in the hope that at least two or three people were willing to
help working on it once it was there. All radio stations still transmit
RDS data, and all car radios and many navigation systems still use it. And
Linux is the only OS that has a documented kernel (!) API for RDS data.

I tried hard to involve other people. I presented the project at the
LinuxTag in Germany in 2006. I gave other programmers write access to the
SVN repository. I offered the same to some others on the video4linux
mailing list. I even offered that somebody else could take over the whole
project and become project leader.

No such luck.

Personally, I simply don't have the time to further support the project.
I'm working full time as a kernel hacker and Linux consultant. I'm sitting
in front of a computer 12 hours each day, and need some time for my house
and my garden and to relax.

I simply overestimated the interest in RDS. Obviously, there are only
10 to 20 Linux programmers in the world who are mildly interested. So far,
none of them was willing to help maintaining this project.

That's the situation at the moment.

If you're willing and able to help out, let me know.

Thanks,
Hans
