</I>
The problem is that SAA7134 I2C support is broken. It loads ir-kbd-i2c,
whether you have a remote control or not. As soon as I load saa6588,
the system hangs. To be more precise, keyboard and mouse stop working, so
it has probably got something to do with the input method registered by
ir-kbd-i2c. I once removed really all of it from the kernel, and then
saa6588 worked as expected.
I reported that problem more than once, but it's not trivial, and nobody
was interested. I haven't got the time to insist here. I sometimes have
two days in which I'd could work on it, and if it's not solved then, I
might not be able to look at it for the next 3 months. After that, the 
kernel has changed so much that I can start from the beginning.

Summary:

- Yes, it could be done with SAA7134, if you're able and willing to hack
  the saa7134 driver.

- An easier way is to get an old bttv card with SAA6588 from eBay :-)

Thanks,
Hans
