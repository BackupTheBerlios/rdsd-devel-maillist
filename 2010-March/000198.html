Hello!

RDS-TMC isn't that big thing. If you have the standard, it's quite simple after that.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Then what you can do with RDS-TMC data is actually quite limited as
</I>&gt;<i> most countries scramble it, but if you have info on this, i'm
</I>&gt;<i> interested :)
</I>
Well. The &quot;encryption&quot; is weak. 30 static &quot;keys&quot;, each one for each day of the month and the location is only scrambled. key number is transmitted in the TMC packet or frame or what was it.

Below is paste from one of my electronics report. I should get that device working. I never fully implemented it. It has been too long and there are now days TMC navigators.

--------


It was dark night in November and I was reading Usenet where people were 
wishing having a car navigator which would be capable receiving RDS-TMC 
information. First I pointed my browser to wikipedia to better 
understand TMC protocol and after a while I followed links and ended up 
to

<A HREF="http://dev.inversepath.com/rds/.">http://dev.inversepath.com/rds/.</A> 
Those terrorist threats and bullfigts just got me totally interested. 
The idea of decoding TMC was born.


It was clear from beginning that in Finland TMC was encrypted but the 
pdf in <A HREF="http://dev.inversepath.com/rds/">http://dev.inversepath.com/rds/</A> gave hope.

 Described in ISO 14819-6

 Only the Location Code is encrypted

 It involves bitwise operations against a key. So that is not hard 
to implement.

I had to know this more about.


 Best thing when you are in technical school, is to get access to 
library. And trough library to standards. When you have the standard 
rest is just applying it. I had pointer and I knew where to get what I 
wanted. Few hours later I had encryption key sniffer. It was overkill 
brute force solution which took always less than 20 encrypted location 
codes to find the key. Time in CPU was always under minute without any 
compiler made optimizations. Was this the encryption? It can't be 
encryption. Just some kind of transmission error which needs to be 
corrected. Weird that it happens always in location code.
 

 How do I know what is right location. Links for Finnish location and 
event tables can be found from

 
<A HREF="http://www.destia.fi/tmc/english/default.asp">http://www.destia.fi/tmc/english/default.asp</A> and comparing results 
of key in trial to true location. There are gaps in location numbers so 
if result is in gap the key is wrong.

So. Rest is just impelement those things. Hopefully I helped.
