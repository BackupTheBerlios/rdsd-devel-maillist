&gt;<i> Hi guys,
</I>
Hi Daniel,

&gt;<i> I'm new to this list and rdsd. I've downloaded the svn version of
</I>&gt;<i> RDSd as I was looking for a rds decoder for my HQCT radio module
</I>&gt;<i> (google hqct). 
</I>
Looks interesting. A bit expensive, but several people on this list
were looking for a device like that. Unfortunately, the xtronic webshop
order form is a bit unorthodox, so I couldn't find out yet if they can
deliver the device to Germany...

&gt;<i> I've adapted the driver for hqct to act (partly) as an
</I>&gt;<i> v4l tuner and to spew the rds data via device read().
</I>
Fine, that's the way it has to be done. Did you already try to post
your driver on the video4linux mailing list? By all means, we should
try to get this into the mainline kernel. If you send me your V4L
driver, I can review it.

&gt;<i> Also I came across a small typo regarding AF decoding, which is now 
</I>&gt;<i> fixed. Would it be possible to get SVN access or do you guys want me
</I>&gt;<i> to send a diff.
</I>
Please send a diff for this one so I can get an idea of what you're
about to do. In general, I've got no problems with giving you SVN write
access then.

&gt;<i> I'm now starting to work on EON implementation (I can't promise 
</I>&gt;<i> anything, but i want this working for myself so i'll probably get it
</I>&gt;<i> to work ;)
</I>
Sounds good :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> regards Daniel
</I>
Thanks,
Hans
