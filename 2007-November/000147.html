&gt;<i> Guys, Guys, please... did I mention it is very very much work in
</I>&gt;<i> progress? I've taken a driver that was written by someone else
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.mp3car.com/vbulletin/827446-post14.html">http://www.mp3car.com/vbulletin/827446-post14.html</A>) and adapted it to
</I>&gt;<i> work with rdsd. That's about as far as I got. You are all right that
</I>&gt;<i> it needs a cleanup and further spell checking etc.etc.
</I>&gt;<i> But that's besides the point of me emailing the source.
</I>
No problem, I understood it that way. That was all just general talk
about what is on the todo list. I'm willing to make an initial review
so that checkpatch.pl doesn't throw warnings anymore. The more
people look over kernel code, the better it gets. Further testing has to
be done by someone who has the hardware available. Maybe I'll buy one,
dunno yet.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyhow I am mostly intersted in what you think about the proposed
</I>&gt;<i> adaptations for EON.
</I>
As I said, your approach looks good to me.

Thanks,
Hans
