</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi guys,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Daniel,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm new to this list and rdsd. I've downloaded the svn version of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RDSd as I was looking for a rds decoder for my HQCT radio module
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (google hqct). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looks interesting. A bit expensive, but several people on this list
</I>&gt;<i> were looking for a device like that. Unfortunately, the xtronic webshop
</I>&gt;<i> order form is a bit unorthodox, so I couldn't find out yet if they can
</I>&gt;<i> deliver the device to Germany...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Well it's supposed to work well for in-car systems with varying signal
strength etc... I don't know if there's a cheaper device that's as good,
or whether it's actually as good as I think it is.
&gt;&gt;<i> I've adapted the driver for hqct to act (partly) as an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> v4l tuner and to spew the rds data via device read().
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fine, that's the way it has to be done. Did you already try to post
</I>&gt;<i> your driver on the video4linux mailing list? By all means, we should
</I>&gt;<i> try to get this into the mainline kernel. If you send me your V4L
</I>&gt;<i> driver, I can review it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Nope not yet, but I just got it to work yesterday and it's not at all
complete yet. But if you'd have a look, that'd be nice and you could
tell me if it's going in the right direction... May I repeat the it's by
no means finished or even complete; it's work in progress...
&gt;&gt;<i> Also I came across a small typo regarding AF decoding, which is now 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fixed. Would it be possible to get SVN access or do you guys want me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to send a diff.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please send a diff for this one so I can get an idea of what you're
</I>&gt;<i> about to do. In general, I've got no problems with giving you SVN write
</I>&gt;<i> access then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>The AF typo is a small diff (see attachment)... the EON stuff is much
bigger I'm afraid.
&gt;&gt;<i> I'm now starting to work on EON implementation (I can't promise 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything, but i want this working for myself so i'll probably get it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to work ;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good :-)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Alright. I'll try to give an idea on how I'm implementing EON and the
changes I think it requires. Bear with me on this...
The EON system should provide a listner with information on related
radio channels. It provides stuff like PICode, station identification,
AF list, pty, traffic anouncements etc.
Following the meaning of the EON part of the RDS standard, I think rdsd
should keep a list of channels it has information about. That makes more
sense than demanding from a client to keep that information.
For the case of the traffic anouncement: the TA event would be raised
and the client can then request the PI code of the referenced TA
channel. The client also requests the AF list for that PI and changes
channel for the duration of the announcement and returns to the original
when TA is finished...

Now for implementation. I think the RDSdecoder contains two types of
data. General data and channel specific data. General data would be
date/time, group counters and events. The rest i.e. PI code, radio text,
AFlist, etc. is channel specific. This channel specific data would be
contained in a seperate struct. RDSdecoder class would then hold a
vector of this channel data. One element is the 'current channel' and
gets updated with normal RDS data. Once EON data is received, elements
are added and filled as appropriate.

Let me know what you think about this.
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regards Daniel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Hans
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
regards,
   Daniel
